### Hello, I'm Vallari 👋

I'm a third year Computer Science undergrad, who loves to build technical solutions to problems relevant around me or some silly hacks for fun. 

- 💻 I'm currently working as an Outreachy summer intern at [Ceph](https://ceph.io/)
- 💻 I’ve worked as an Software Engineering Intern at [Setu](https://setu.co/)
- 🥇 I'm a **Women Techmakers Engineering Fellow**, a scholarship by Talentsprint and Google
- 🥇 I've recieved AnitaB.org's scholarship to attend **Grace Hopper Conf'21**
- 🖋️ I love to pen down articles to share what I'm learning and to understand concepts better. Checkout my [blog](https://blog.vallariag.dev/).
