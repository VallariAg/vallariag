### Hello, I'm Vallari 👋

I'm a fourth year Computer Science undergrad, who loves to build technical solutions to problems relevant around her or some silly hacks for fun. 

- 💻 I'm currently working at [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) as a backend engineering intern.
- 💻 I've contributed to [Ceph](https://github.com/ceph/) as an Outreachy Summer Intern'22. 
- 💻 I’ve also worked as an Software Intern at [Setu](https://setu.co/).
- 🥇 I'm a **Women Techmakers Engineering Fellow**, a scholarship by Talentsprint and Google.
- 🥇 I've recieved AnitaB.org's scholarship to attend **Grace Hopper Conf'21**.
- 🖋️ I love to pen down articles to share what I'm learning and to understand concepts better. Checkout my [technical blog](https://stuff-i-learn.netlify.app/).
